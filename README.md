# [DeepLearning.AI-Natural-Language-Processing-Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing)
 This repository contains all of my solutions for labs from the DeepLearning.AI Natural Language Processing Specialization on Coursera.
 
 
 # About the specialization
 This Specialization is designed and taught by two experts in NLP, machine learning, and deep learning. Younes Bensouda Mourri is an Instructor of AI at Stanford University who also helped build the Deep Learning Specialization. ≈Åukasz Kaiser is a Staff Research Scientist at Google Brain and the co-author of Tensorflow, the Tensor2Tensor and Trax libraries, and the Transformer paper.
